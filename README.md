# Prediction Of Alzheimer's Disease
Prediction of Alzheimer’s disease using  Machine Learning Algorithms - SVM and RF

The objective is to identify dementia in a variety of individuals. The dataset containing MRI brain 
scans is utilized to foresee Alzheimer's sickness or dementia in grown-up patients.

The data is examined and two machine learning models are used for prediction - support vector machines and random forests.
The approach is straightforward and can quickly assist individuals in recognizing Alzheimer’s 
disease. The results obtained with the two models are compared.

##Dataset
Prediction of Alzheimer's disease is made using the dataset containing the MRI scans of various individuals. The dataset was acquired from the Kaggle Open source environment.
[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images) is divided into 2 classes, Alzheimer's and no-Alzheimer’s which consist of MRI 
scans of brains.
