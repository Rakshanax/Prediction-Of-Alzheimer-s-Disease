# Prediction-Of-Alzheimer's-Disease
Prediction of Alzheimer’s disease using  Machine Learning Algorithms - SVM and RF

The objective is to identify dementia in a variety of individuals. The dataset containing MRI brain 
scans is utilized to foresee Alzheimer's sickness or dementia in grown-up patients.

The data is examined and two machine learning models are used for prediction - support vector machines and random forests.
The approach is straightforward and can quickly assist individuals in recognizing Alzheimer’s 
disease.
